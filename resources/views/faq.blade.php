                    Yes, actually. You might try updating your User.cfg file. More details can be found here:Editing Your User Config File

                    We are  only human, and make mistakes. If you feel there was an error, please get in touch with either Ixi or judahnator on the LTT forums.<br>
                    We will get you sorted out. You might check to see if you were applying on the PTU site. That might be the root of the problem.
